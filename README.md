# Parallax_Website
This is a group project where we create an informative website about "Artificial Intelligence" and all its advances. The website includes a good percentage of parallax effects in the background of each page. The team created a base design for the home page and content pages on Figma, but each member introduced his own style while building the website.

## The following images show the concept design of our Home page

This project was built entirely using HTML/CSS and following concepts such as flexbox, parallax effect and UI/UX design. This project was a good opportunity to work on our HTML and CSS skills, and also work as a team using Git/Github.
We used many resources to built this page, one resource used was [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com).
