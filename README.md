# Parallax_Website
This is a group project where we created an informative website about "Artificial Intelligence" and all its advances. The website includes a good percentage of parallax effect in the background on each page from this website. The team created a based design for the home page and content pages on Figma, but we as a team could make our changes through the process of building the website.

This project was built entirely using HTML/CSS and following concepts such as flexboxs, parallax effect and UI/UX design. Also, this project was a good practice to work on our skills on HTML/CSS and how to work as a team using Git/Github.
we used resources to built this page, one resources used was from [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com).
