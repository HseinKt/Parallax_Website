                    <span>Artificial intelligence (AI)</span> refers to the <span>simulation of human intelligence</span> in machines
                    that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be 
                    applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning 
                    and problem-solving.
                    <br>
                    The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take 
                    actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence
                    is machine learning (ML), which refers to the concept that computer programs can <span>automatically learn
                    from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans</span>.

                    The advantages of Artificial intelligence applications are enormous 
                    and can revolutionize any professional sector. Let’s see some of them

                        With Artificial intelligence, the decisions are taken from the previously gathered 
                        information applying a certain set of algorithms. So errors are reduced and the chance 
                        of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility.

                        This is one of the biggest advantages of Artificial intelligence. We can overcome 
                        many risky limitations of humans by developing an AI Robot which in turn can do the 
                        risky things for us.

                        of work. But using AI we can make machines work 24x7 without any breaks and they don’t even get bored, 
                        unlike humans.

                        Using AI alongside other technologies we can make machines take decisions faster than a human and carry out 
                        actions quicker. While taking a decision human will analyze many factors both emotionally and practically 
                        but AI delivers the results in a faster way.
